# ERS
The goal of this project is to create a Java Full Stack Employee Reimbursement System (ERS). The main use case of the ERS centers around Employees submitting Reimbursements that can either be accepted or denied by Managers. The tech stack will consist of a React-Based Front end, communicating via HTTP to a Spring-Based Back end. The database will be either a local or cloud-based Postgres database. The entire application will have error handling in place to prevent the user from invoking unauthorized functionalities or entering invalid inputs.
